## About Me

### Turning chaos into harmony

I like untangling gnarly systems and leaving them faster, clearer, and kinder to the next engineer. I'm a game developer and C++ generalist: I implement gameplay, build engine tools, ship UI with Qt, Slate, and Android, and design backend microservices for client/server applications and multiplayer games. I do Unreal Engine tooling, CI/CD, and cross-platform automation. I've developed tools such as functional test frameworks, device orchestration with performance telemetry, crash reporting pipelines, and large-scale asset verification. Before games, I shipped at DirecTV across the full stack, from Linux kernel and drivers to Android TV UI and backend services, all while helping teams reach sprint-based Android TV releases with Google certification. My number one engineering goal is simple: make working software that people genuinely enjoy using.
